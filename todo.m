% DONE! - d3, bw13_193a : TAGID variable is missing  WHAHOO THIS ONE WORKS NOW
% DONE! - d3, bw13_214c "missing variable Aa" (in the output nc, I think)?
% first time I tried above, didn't duplicate the error. Maybe bc of other
% fixes to prh2nc.
% DONE! - d3, bw14_218a, error at line 138 of prh2nc (sens_struct for p)
% DONE! - d3, bw14_218a, bw193a also unable to make cue file for swvs (during prh2nc)
